# CodeJudge - Online Coding Test
Task is to design an Online Coding Test App with IDE for famous programming languages like Python, C++, C, Java. This will be just like Hackerrank, but with fewer functionalities. The user will login using pre-provided credentials, complete the test and then the score will be recorded in database for Test Admins. Test Admins will have ability to make a test and send invitations for the same. Additional features could include integrating with MOSS and tracking of the user using computer vision to predict use of unfair means.
